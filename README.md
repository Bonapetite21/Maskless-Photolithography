# Maskless-Photolithography
Capstone Maskless Photolithography

In this project we shall make a maskless photolithography machine using a DMD with an EUV LED to hardened photoresist. Create a moving stage that will step through the patterns with micron percission uding ball screw linear actuators connected to a stepper motor and a linear glass encoder to determine position on the x/y axis.
